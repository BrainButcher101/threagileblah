# NOTE:
#
# For a perfect editing experience within your IDE of choice you can easily
# get model syntax validation and autocompletion (very handy for enum values)
# as well as live templates: Just import the schema.json into your IDE and assign
# it as "schema" to each Threagile YAML file. Also try to import individual parts
# from the live-templates.txt file into your IDE as live editing templates.
#
# You might also want to try the REST API when running in server mode...

abuse_cases:
  Denial-of-Service: >
    As a hacker I want to disturb the functionality of the backend system in order to cause indirect
    financial damage via unusable features. And attack the availablity of the service as such.
  Ransomware: >
    As a hacker I want to encrypt the storage and file systems in order to demand ransom.
  Identity Theft: >
    As a hacker I want to steal identity data in order to reuse credentials and/or keys on other targets of the same company or outside.
  PII Theft: >
    As a hacker I want to steal PII (Personally Identifiable Information) data in order to blackmail the company and/or damage
    their repudiation by publishing them.
  Database Compromise: >
    As a hacker I want to access the database backend of the Frontend in order to steal/modify sensitive
    business data.
  Cross-Site Scripting Attacks: >
    As a hacker I want to execute Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and similar attacks in order to takeover victim sessions and
    cause reputational damage and eventually damage on the customer side.
  Denial-of-Service of Enduser Functionality: >
    As a hacker I want to disturb the functionality of the enduser parts of the application in order to cause direct financial
    damage (lower sales).


security_requirements:
  Input Validation: Strict input validation is required to reduce the overall attack surface.
  Securing Administrative Access: Administrative access must be secured with strong encryption and multi-factor authentication.
  EU-DSGVO: Mandatory EU-Datenschutzgrundverordnung
  Encryption: We need to apply strict encryption of customer sensitive data

# NOTE:
# For risk tracking each risk-id needs to be defined (the string with the @ sign in it). These unique risk IDs
# are visible in the PDF report (the small grey string under each risk), the Excel (column "ID"), as well as the JSON responses.
# Some risk IDs have only one @ sign in them, while others multiple. The idea is to allow for unique but still speaking IDs.
# Therefore each risk instance creates its individual ID by taking all affected elements causing the risk to be within an @-delimited part.
# Using wildcards (the * sign) for parts delimited by @ signs allows to handle groups of certain risks at once. Best is to lookup the IDs
# to use in the created Excel file. Alternatively a model macro "seed-risk-tracking" is available that helps in initially
# seeding the risk tracking part here based on already identified and not yet handled risks.
